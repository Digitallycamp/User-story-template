# Sports Highlight & News App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the core requirements and user stories for the development of a new sports highlight and news application. The goal is to address key user frustrations identified through surveys and deliver a comprehensive, reliable, and engaging platform for sports enthusiasts, particularly focusing on football (soccer) but with the capacity for multi-sport coverage.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Sports enthusiasts**, particularly avid **football followers**, are currently frustrated by existing sports apps that suffer from **frequent lagging, freezing, delayed score updates, and a significant lack of detailed, comprehensive statistics** (including H2H and minor league data).

Furthermore, their ability to **seamlessly access and enjoy timely, diverse, and engaging match highlights** (featuring elements like commentary, drama, and quick pacing) is hindered by an often **fragmented experience**, forcing them to jump between multiple unreliable platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) and contend with inconsistent app performance and resetting preferences.

This leads to a **disjointed and frustrating user experience**, preventing them from staying fully informed and immersed in their favorite sports moments from a single, reliable source.
